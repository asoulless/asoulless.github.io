Writing about myself is <abbr title="kutsuu; pain">苦痛</abbr>, so I put it into a bunch of blocks instead!

Some things that I'm typically doing:

- Playing Persona 5 Royal
- Making/editing videos
- Getting lost down mental rabbit holes
- Hanging out with friends

I actually made <a href="/img/bg.png">the background for this website</a> myself. Well, not entirely. Some of the icons used in the background were made with some of the <a class="external" href="https://phosphoricons.com">Phosphor Icons</a>. It's the same wallpaper that I use on my own devices (with a tweaked version for my phone).

Lots of people in my life know me for being good with technology, but I find myself enjoying designing and putting things together. It's not something that I would want to do as a job, though...

I actually have high-functioning (or level 1 for a more specific term) autism. That generally means that I can typically get around just fine in my life, but there are still things that will take me a bit longer, such as trying to think through a question to give a response, or that I'll just need help with. It's not something I tend to tell people about, though...
