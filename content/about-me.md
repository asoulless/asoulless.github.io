~~<small>writing about myself is 苦痛</small>~~

## Hi! I'm Yoru.
To be honest, I'm still not sure what to put here (I guess some things never change ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯). I play games, work on projects, and sometimes hang out with friends (though I should really do that last one more often...). Maybe I should just add everything in some blocks like what [Mambuco](https://mambuco.dev/about) and [Daudix](https://daudix.one/home/#about) did...

<ul class="masonry">
    <li>
        <article>
            this is a test
        </article>
    </li>
<li>
<article class="fancy-list">
    
**and now a test with subs**

- this
- that,
- and that other thing

</article>
</li>
</ul>
