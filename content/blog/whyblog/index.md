<summary>Music I was listening to while writing this</summary>

I was mainly listening to 2 Mello's *Sunsound Collisions* album at 80% speed. While you don't have to listen to it at that speed while you read this short post (or listen to it at all), if you want to set it to that exact speed, you can set the speed in the video settings by selecting the cog in the bottom right of the video, and setting the video speed to `0.8`.

When I remade my website, one of the biggest reasons for this was so that I could start a proper blog in the same place as my personal space on the internet. It was a wish mainly inspired by many of the websites that I had seen on the indie web (and especially [Daudix's website](https://daudix.one)) that followed the same practice. As I had stated on the page for [The Patch Notes](@/projects/patch-notes/index.md), I had already been doing that in some capacity on that public Logseq graph.

My original decision to publish some pages of my Logseq graph came from my own reason to use Logseq in the first place. Originally, I was doing my journaling in a Word document. But as time went on, I found myself having a harder time focusing on just writing, as I would get mentally stuck while trying to think of something to write about from that day. I then decided to try to use Markdown files to jot down thoughts to write about later, later found out about and tried using Logseq, and eventually, *that* ended up being the app that I was using to journal with. Logseq made it so easy for me to link together ideas and write in a format that matched my disjointed thought process that I just continued to use it. Once I realized that I could publish pages of my graph publicly, I realized that I could get my messy thoughts out there! *I could say something!*

But alas, I'm trying something new here: I'm starting a proper blog. Not one made of disjointed blocks of text, but one made of properly formatted paragraphs and such. Why? For a few short reasons:

First, because **the way that I see it, writing is nothing more than methodically combining and organizing a bunch of ideas to express them.** It's a way of expressing oneself. It's really cool to me, and it's something that I want to try out for myself. Besides, I'm going to have to do it in the future if I'm going to somehow get the elusive 20-figure job that my parents seem to want me to get. But that's a minor reason for wanting to write more. It's important, but I'm not focusing on it for that reason. Of course, it may not be that special to some people, but for me, whose brain seems to be constantly moving, it's very fascinating.

This actually leads me into my second reason: **starting this blog and actually making posts for it actually forces me to slow down.** I was recently introduced to another way to look at the current issues that I have in contrast to my current one: it may not be that I'm just struggling to connect ideas together, but that I'm just going too fast (that's at least how I understood it). Thinking about it, it actually started to make sense. My brain seems to be running on a constant rhythm that never seems to slow down; I don't like slowing down at all, so whenever someone or something interrupts me, it actually feels like someone came at me with an entire freight train.

So yeah, that's about it: I've seen people make their thoughts look pretty, so I wanna make my thoughts look pretty, too. ~~i sound like a little kid saying that lol~~ Hopefully, I continue to keep this updated and write stuff for this blog.
