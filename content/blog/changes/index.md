As of late, life has felt... boring, to put it lightly.

It's not necessarily that I'm bored; I have plenty of things to do, but... life doesn't feel like it has anything worth working for.

My parents have been telling me to get a job for years, even while I was still in ~~High School EX~~ college, and while I only feel marginally closer to that goal now, I, unfortunately, don't really have much of a personal desire to get a job. No amount of money or the things that it could get me could drive me to actively try to get a job that doesn't even seem to exist in today's job market. I trust that they just want me to be well off in this country, but it still doesn't drive me to earnestly try, even if I try to for their sake.

Recently, <a class="external" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">Google has announced plans to basically lock down Android in the name of security</a> by making it to where you can only install apps made by developers that Google verifies, and for once, I seriously considered switching to iOS because those changes would have basically turned Android into that same operating system, but under a company that likely cares less for your privacy. Even now that <a class="external" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html">they've announced that they'll have an "advanced flow that allows experienced users to accept the risks of installing software that isn't verified"</a>, an iPhone as my next phone has started to actually look tempting because... it's starting to feel like it's not worth trying to be personally invested in a device whose designers clearly don't want you to make it your own.

And for bonus points, hearing and seeing political news, especially in the U.S., only exacerbates this feeling even more. I don't even look for political news; the Invidious instance that I use has the popular feed set as the home page (though that's more on me; I could always change it on my end and set a cookie), and my sister will often times bring political news that she sees in her own feeds to me (nothing against her by any means; I'm sure she's just trying to vent her frustration).

All of these things have had me feeling pretty down as of late, save for when I'm playing *Persona 5 Royal* or working on some other personal projects of mine. It's getting to the point to where I've actually started wondering if I'm struggling with depression again. Especially tonight before I started writing this, as I was feeling down again, but I was having a hard time tracing it back to anything. However, I think I have more of a theory as to why I've been feeling so down as of late, as well as what may have been hindering me all these years.

## Relationships
I often go down what I call "mental rabbit holes" in my mind, which often tend to be scenarios that I plan walk through despite me often reminding myself that they ~~very, very likely~~ won't happen. As much as I hate to admit it, they often revolve around romance. Not viewed through rose-tinted glasses, but often, ironically enough, through the lightning and flashes of *fear*, of all things. As creepy as it may sound, relationships are quite fascinating to watch from afar. I've come to understand them as two people deciding that they're gonna stick together through this hell of a rollercoaster of existence. Put another way, they're life partners. It's this and the small moments of affection that they show one another that never fail to make me smile. So, if that's the way I see them, then how could I experience fear during these types of mental rabbit holes?

Notice how I referred to people in these relationships as *life* partners. Not "partners for this project", not "partners for a time", **life** partners. It means that they stay together for the rest of their lives. The problem with this, though, is that, as living beings, we all have this special ability that, though others can attempt to snuff it out, it can never be killed: it is the ability to choose, the ability to make choices; it is <a class="colored">｢free will｣</a>. With this ability, we can choose to stay in these life partnerships, and we can choose to love our partners. However, with this ability, we can also choose to act in ways that harm our partners, harm those who depend on us, or, we can ultimately decide that we don't want to continue in this relationship anymore. That is, **we can choose to change**.

## A singular constant
<small>They (whoever they is) say that the only constant in this world is change. The only thing that will ever stay the same is that things will change.</small>

For most of my childhood, my parents have been divorced. Eventually, my siblings and I were doing the whole split custody shenanigans, spending some time with our mom and some time with our dad for at least 8 years of my life. From my experience, split custody solves the issue of making sure that both parents who can't peaceably live together can still spend time with their kids, but it solves this problem at the cost of *stability*. The children will never really be able to truly settle down as they move back and forth between places. Even if it's between two places that always stay the same, the environment never remains stable (once again, this is based on my own experiences; I haven't done my research, but every child is different, and the effects may be also be different).

So, the constant back and forth, combined with other factors in one parent's house over the other, led me to learn, on a very low level, that *everything can, and often will, change*. As contradictory as this may sound, that doesn't produce an adult ready to take on the world; it produces a child still holding on to what little stability they have left. This doesn't even take into consideration the undiagnosed autism I was dealing with.

## Fear of the singular constant
My own internal fear of change is something that has crossed my mind before, but it is only now that I've come to realize just how much it has affected me.

A job doesn't interest me because in my mind, I have to somehow manage to appeal to the employer, and even if I manage to cross that hurdle, then I'm left at the mercies of my employer for my wellbeing. I think the tech industry layoffs are proof enough of this fact. Of course, I could attempt to make sure that I'm always employed by staying up to date with the newest technologies, but I don't want to deal with a rat race that continues to grow at hyper-exponential speeds. Even if I were to get hired at some company making lots of money like my parents want me to, I would likely live in fear that I could simply not make the cut when they start laying people off.

A relationship, while fascinating and beautiful to me, doesn't interest me because of my constant fear that not only she could change, but that I could change, too. She 

In either case, while the girlfriend leaving doesn't feel like as major of a change as being laid off from a job, in my stability-craving mind, both
