I've made quite a number of videos and posted them to YouTube. A lot of them are gaming montages, some of them are me fooling around with a video editor and a funny moment, and some of them are actually more experimental. As of late, I've been getting back into making videos again, though it's mainly been clip compilations. Nevertheless, here are the channels that I've used over the years:

## Yoru C. Heartless
My current "main" channel where I'm just posting whatever (which, as of writing, has mainly been Persona 5 Royal clip compilations). Maybe I'll post something that's more structured in the future...

I originally made nekobu to be the "2nd channel" to SupaKidu, where I would post videos like the shorter ones from the main channel. Eventually, it just ended up being a very experimental channel where I posted videos that followed whatever style I could get out there.

## SupaKidu
SupaKidu was the first YouTube channel where I started consistently posting videos. Most of these are gaming montages, and most of those are SRB2Kart montages. When I was making videos for this channel, I was mainly focused on trying to get views on the channel, especially after how well [my second SRB2Kart video](https://youtu.be/pNm4Z107Ymw) did. Alas, this didn't really work out, even with how well [everyday karting](https://youtu.be/BKGyj14LU60) did. I still had a good time making these videos, though.
