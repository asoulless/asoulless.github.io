The current website you're on right now! This one was made using <a class="external" href="https://getzola.org/">Zola</a> and Daudix's <a class="external" href="https://duckquill.daudix.one/">Duckquill</a> theme. Originally, I was thinking of using his <a class="external" href="https://ametrine.daudix.one/">Amertrine</a> theme, but that one's still in its pre-alpha state (and I couldn't figure out how to fix the issues I was having with it when I did attempt to use it fast enough lol), so I just settled on Duckquill. I think the website's leagues better than [the old one](@/projects/old-website/index.md) I had.

## Thanks!
I wanted to thank some people for the tools used for this website.

- <a class="external" href="https://daudix.one/">Daudix</a>, of course, for the Duckquill theme
- <a class="external" href="https://mambuco.dev/">Mambuco</a>, actually, whose site I used as a bit of a reference for mine, especially for the [about me](@/about-me.md) page and the masonry layout. I ~~copied~~ referenced the source code for his and Daudix's websites for that page.
- <a class="external" href="https://iniox.github.io/">InioX</a> for <a class="external" href="https://github.com/InioX/matugen/">Matugen</a>, which I used for the accent colors used across various pages on this website.
