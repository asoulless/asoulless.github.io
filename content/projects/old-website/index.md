The original website hosted on [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page/). I wrote the entire thing without an <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>, since I wanted more control over how the site looked in general. Up to that point, it was the most extensive programming project that I had seen from start to finish outside of schoolwork.

From the original description of the project:

> I originally wanted to make a personal website for a while, but it wasn't until my friend asked me to put together a portfolio so he could show it to people that I really got into putting the website together. It doesn't feel professional, but it feels like me, and I believe that that's all that really matters.
>
> This mainly took me such a long time because I often needed to find the motivation to try and work on each part of the website. The most difficult part was the CSS, since I can tend to get really particular about how I want things to look or work. There was some research that I had to do in how I could make the website look at times and how to get certain things to work (like the mobile version of this site, especially with the side menu), but, at long last, it's finally done.
>
> What's ironic, though, is that I don't know if I would want to do this again. The website looks nice, and I'm so thankful to God for His help in helping me finally get to this point, but at this point, it's just a website now. It kind of feels like me, but at this point, it's been starting to feel more like a program like the ones I've made for college; arbitrary, and needing some injection of me in order to bring enough value to it to make me want to finish it...
>
> Maybe it has something to do with just how tired I am as I'm drafting this out.

Unfortunately, I completely forgot about updating that website, so it's very outdated. Hopefully, using an SSG will make maintaining this site easier. I still plan on keeping it up or preserving it, though.
